# Hello World

This is the first post in my new blog! Take a look around. Everything you see (both frontend and backend) is built with vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries at all. Although my code is pretty crap and is likely not as performant and tested as other maintained frameworks and repositories, it's important to recognize the value of responsible and good-old fashioned code.

## Replit Features

Ok obviously we didn't use _zero_ libraries or frameworks. We used some cool Replit features!
