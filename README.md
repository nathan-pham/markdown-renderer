# Markdown Renderer

A vanilla Markdown parser and renderer. Needs heavy optimization and refactoring - use a different library instead. Currently supports images, links, lists, and code blocks.

## Example Usage

creating a new Markdown class

```js
import Markdown from "./Markdown.js";
import * as fs from "fs";

const markdown = new Markdown(fs.readFileSync("./replit-post.md", "utf-8"));
console.log(markdown.render());
```

rendered HTML (formatted for readability):

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
    This blog was created for the
    <a href="https://blog.replit.com/template-jam">Replit Template Jam</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This is the first post in my new blog! Take a look around. Everything you
    see (both frontend and backend) is built with vanilla JavaScript. No
    frameworks or libraries at all. Although my code is pretty crap and is
    likely not as performant and tested as other maintained frameworks and
    repositories, it's important to recognize the value of responsible and
    good-old fashioned code.

<h2>Replit Features</h2>
<p>
    Ok obviously we didn't use <i>zero</i> libraries or frameworks. We used some
    cool Replit features!
